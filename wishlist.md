## Possible improvements

-   Bug: image does not persist in local storage (impossible on client side only?)
-   Bug: On edit, image field is empty, but preview has image. (solution could be to not show "browse" unless user has deleted old photo)
-   Feat: (UX idea) Click outside Form modal to close it
-   Feat: (UX idea) Alert "Are you sure?" when deleting a cat entry in the list (if clicked by mistake for example)
-   Chore: abstract smaller components, make "defaultbutton" and input fields into their own comps with props to future-proof the project better
